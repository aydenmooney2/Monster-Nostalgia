# Monster-Nostalgia
This project is a responsive, animated website dedicated to my favorite childhood toy, Monster High. Inspired by the bold colors, spooky aesthetic, and empowering themes of individuality, this site blends nostalgia with modern front-end design techniques.  The website expresses a cyber-goth visual theme using neon accents, and other features!
