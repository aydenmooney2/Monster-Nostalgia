        <h2>Why Monster High Was So Special</h2>
        <p>
            Monster High was more than just dolls — it was an entire world of
            bold fashion, spooky style, and powerful messages about being yourself.
            Being born the day before Halloween made the aesthetic feel even more magical.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each character represented a different personality and cliché,
            but they flipped those stereotypes into strengths.

        <h2>The Movies & Adventures</h2>
        <p>
            I watched every Monster High movie growing up. The music,
            adventures, and humor made it unforgettable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rewatching them now, I notice jokes and humor I never understood as a kid —
            which makes the franchise even more fun today.

        <h2>Crossover Magic: Ever After High</h2>
        <p>
            One of the coolest moments was when Cupid crossed over into
            Ever After High. It made both worlds feel connected and bigger.
        </p>
        <p>
            The contrast between spooky Monster High and royal Ever After High
            made both franchises even more exciting.
        </p>

    <section id="nostalgia">
        <h2>Why It Still Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Monster High is comforting because it connects who I was as a kid
            to who I am now. It reminds me to embrace individuality and creativity.
